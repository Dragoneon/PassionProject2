Hello there! As the indication states, I am Daniel. Born and raised in the States, American food is a favorite, and anything from fast-food restaurants to buffets appeal to me. From young age, video games were always addicting, with my first being a pixelated adventure and now a widely popular MOBA, League of Legends. Science and math have been my strong subjects, but I still have much to learn. After school, I either code or browse the internet. I believe that cryptocurrencies will become the future way of trading, and have invested in Bitcoin and Litecoin. My favorite quote is by Ralph Waldo Emerson, for he once proclaimed, “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”

Hi there! My name is Joshua. I am born in the United States like Daniel. Being the creative person I am, I have created a spinner wheel and a pinball machine out of cardboard and some other materials. My favorite subject is math and I am in my school's math team. I also one got first in my school's math team rankings. Some other school clubs that I go to and enjoy are Science Olympiad and robotics. I am the leader of the robotics team that I am in and we won one of our competitions so far this year. Outside of school, I play the piano, and participate in fencing. I also play soccer since I was four. My hobbies includes building, programming, playing video games, and just having fun. As Avril Lavigne once said, "Life is like a roller coaster, live it, be happy, enjoy life."
