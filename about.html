Hello there! As the indication states, I am Daniel. Born and raised in the States, American food is a favorite, and anything from fast-food restaurants to buffets appeal to me. From young age, video games were always addicting, with my first being a pixelated adventure and now a widely popular MOBA, League of Legends. Science and math have been my strong subjects, but I still have much to learn. After school, I either code or browse the internet. I believe that cryptocurrencies will become the future way of trading, and have invested in Bitcoin and Litecoin. My favorite quote is by Ralph Waldo Emerson, for he once proclaimed, “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”

Hi there! My name is Joshua. I am born in the United States. I am creative and like to build things. My favorite subject is math and I like messing around with technology and code. I like to play video games. I am in my school's science club for two years. In addition, I am in my school's math team and got first place in my school's rankings. I am also one of the school's rookie robotics team's programmer and our robot won all of our robot games this school year. Outside of school, I play the piano, I participate in fencing, and play soccer.
