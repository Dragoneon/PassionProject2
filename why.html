      Why, You Ask? <br><br>
      Here at SimPLight, we built Farewell-Fly on the foundation of simplicity. As unsophisticated as it may seem, it still has the full potential as the more expensive, stylish products. With the ability to move from place to place, Farewell-Fly was built to be shifted from place to place. Built with only a few pieces, it is no wonder why virtually everyone can have one. Farewell-Fly is the simple device ever created to prevent flies and insects from all people, elders or teens, hikers or tech support, and truck drivers or tourists.

        From the office to the kitchen, Farewell-Fly has a multitude of uses.

        <!-- Make the items into boxes that have initial image but then have facts when on hover--> <!-- Online Images + product photoshopped in -->
        <li div class="boxes boxes1"><p>At the kitchen, flies often wander in search of fruit and sweets. Farewell-Fly conveniently removes the issue.</p></li>
        <li div class="boxes boxes2"><p>Sometimes, by unlucky chance, a couple flies come through seemingly buzzing for hours. The Farewell-Fly conveniently pushes the flies aside.</p></li>
        <li div class="boxes boxes3"><p>During work, hours of productivity are sometimes disturbed and interrupted by the buzz of a fly in a face. However, with our product, some logical positioning will prevent such.</p></li>
        <li div class="boxes boxes4"><p>While on evening hikes or walks, bugs are out the most. To make sure insects canâ€™t bite, you can simply insert in a pocket. </p></li>
        <li div class="boxes boxes5"><p>When camping out, you would not want to awaken, finding that bugshare bitten you from top to bottom. By setting the Farewell-Fly near the open holes, you can rest assured that none will come in.</p></li>
        <li div class="boxes boxes6"><p>Vacation is a time of rest, to recharge batteries, and have a good time. While either lying under a hammock near the beach or touring the American forests, the Farewell-Fly will be a definite essential.</p></li>
